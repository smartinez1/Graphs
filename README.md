# Graphs

## Homework

1.Modify the given code implementing GCNConv with message passing from  scratch. Compare your results with the ones obtained without this modification

2.Add more convolutional layers (at least 3 different experiments!), What do you expect? show your results and compare them to the ones obtained before.

3. (optional) implement a GraphSAGE convolutional layer and replace the GCNConv with it. show your results and compare!
