# Graphs

## Homework

1. Modify the given code implementing GCNConv with message passing from  scratch. Compare your results with the ones obtained without this modification

2. Add more convolutional layers (at least 3 different experiments!), What do you expect? show your results and compare them to the ones obtained before.

3. (optional) implement a GraphSAGE convolutional layer and replace the GCNConv with it. show your results and compare! 

In order to achieve all these tasks you'll need to install pytorch-geometric. All the information you need about it is in the next link https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notes/installation.html
